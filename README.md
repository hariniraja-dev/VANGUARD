# 🚨 VANGUARD – Industrial Hazard Monitoring System

**VANGUARD** is a TinyML-powered Industrial IoT safety system designed for real-time hazard detection and early warning.

## 🎯 Overview

The system continuously monitors industrial environmental conditions using multiple sensors connected to an **ESP32**. Sensor data is analyzed locally to classify hazards and provide fast alerts.

## ✨ Features

* 🌡️ Temperature & humidity monitoring using **DHT22**
* 🔥 Gas detection using **MQ2**
* 🌫️ Air-quality monitoring using **MQ135**
* 🧠 **TinyML / Edge AI** hazard classification
* 📡 Long-range communication using **LoRa**
* 💾 Offline data logging using **SPIFFS**
* 📱 Mobile status monitoring using **Bluetooth**
* 🌐 Real-time **Web Dashboard**
* ☁️ **ThingSpeak** integration for remote monitoring
* 🚨 Local LED/LCD alerts

## ⚙️ Hazard Classification

The system can identify:

* ✅ SAFE
